# SENG474 project: stock price prediction for GME (Gamestop corporation)

To create the project, first ensure necessary libraries are installed

run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" to install necessary libraries if they do not exist.

=======================

# for group members:

Currently, I think the best way forward would probably be to create two branches: main and dev.

main is supposed to be the branch that "always works". The dev branch will be for testing/making new features. Once we all agree on a change to dev, we can merge one of our branches to dev, and after verifying stuff works on dev, we can merge to main.

When you clone this repo, switch to the dev branch, and create a branch from the dev branch (your own new branch. Try to give a descriptive name for what you intend to do on that new branch)

When you write commit messages, try to keep them short and clear as to what you've done.
