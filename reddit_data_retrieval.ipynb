       "  '&gt;To whom it may concern,  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;This letter serves to bring the SEC’s attention to suspected illegal activity in GameStop Corporation’s (ticker GME) trading. As a shareholder in GME, I have concerns about illegal naked short selling and increasing failure-to-deliver rates in the month of December 2020 through present day. GME has consistently appeared on the NYSE Threshold Security list for the last 18 trading days. In order to appear on the threshold list, a stock has to have 0.05% of outstanding shares fail-to-deliver, for GameStop this amounts to roughly 350,000 shares. GME’s failure to-delivery rates have exceed this amount on most trading days in December 2020\\\\*.\\\\* Furthermore, on at least three trading days in December, the total number of shares failed-to-deliver exceeded 1 million\\\\*. Below is a summary of trading days in December which had exceptionally high failures-to-deliver:\\\\*  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;12/1: 91,971 @ $16.56  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;12/2: 1,061,397 @ $15.80  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;12/3: 1,787,191 @ $16.58  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;12/4: 999,475 @ $16.12  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;12/7: 1,002,379 @ $16.90  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;12/8: 872,292 @ $16.35  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;12/9: 721,361 @ $16.94  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;12/10: 605,975 @ $13.66  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;12/11: 880,063 @ $14.12  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;12/14: 284,296 @ $13.31  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;Given the data presented above, I request the SEC to further investigate suspected illegal naked short-selling in GME, particularly as it concerns Melvin Capital, who holds a substantial short position in the Company.\\n\\nSubmission Number: 16098-982-327 was submitted successfully on Tuesday, January 05, 2021 at 09:23:49 PM EST\\n\\n[https://imgur.com/a/LOlMC4y](https://imgur.com/a/LOlMC4y)',\n",

So much so that I actually opened a short position at 49.27 in anticipation of bouncing off of it and falling to 45.\\n\\n\\nThat sell wall wasn't defeated, but the entity that put it in place removed it, which is why the stock blew right through and didn't slow down again until about 52.  The important thing, though, was that the next sell wall?  Wasn't until EIGHTY FIVE.  I've never closed a short position so quickly in my life.  The moment I saw it at 50.58 I knew there was no resistance at all and I took my loss immediately.\\n\\n\\nThe removal of that wall was a total capitulation by sellers, who waved the white flag.  Had it not been for the circuit breakers, $GME would have ABSOLUTELY gotten over 100 yesterday.  The only reason it closed as low as it did yesterday was because retail investors aren't used to seeing circuit breakers.  They don't understand them or why they're in place.  So it scared them.  Because why wouldn't it be scary when a stock stops trading?  That gave people who weren't even really looking at GME a few minutes to prepare to open large short positions, which is why you saw the stock absolutely plummet after the 2nd breaker - so much so that it triggered a downside breaker.    But if you look at the sell-side during that downswing, it was all tiny sell orders.  50 shares here, 100 shares there, some 20's, etc.  It was  🧻🤚 running for the hills because they didn't understand what was happening.  So even after that 2nd breaker, there was no real conviction on the sell side.  Which is why the stock was able to rebound to 65 from 57.\\n\\n\\nThis is all a very long TL:DR of saying everybody keeps saying 420.69 as a joke, but....I wouldn't laugh if I were you, because when these squeezes and margin calls happen, there's absolutely no sell conviction to keep the price from skyrocketing.  And every time it happens, it creates a higher low.\"],\n",

Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!\\n\\nFurthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!\\n\\nREAD THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!\\n\\nEVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!\\n\\nSince it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )\\n\\nWhen do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )\\n\\nToo much disinformation about when to sell. I\\'m tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\\n\\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\\n\\nOfficial definition:\\n\\n• \\u2060Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company\\'s issued shares that have been shorted. • \\u2060Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • \\u2060A high \\'days to cover\\' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\\n\\nDumbed down version:\\n\\n• \\u2060imagine you\\'re Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it\\'ll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it\\'s 50,000 dildos a day, then it\\'s 20 days. • \\u2060Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\\n\\nNow you know what day\\'s to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\\n\\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it\\'s gonna take them DAYS, and right now it\\'s gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\\n\\nSo what does that mean for us?\\n\\nWell, we\\'re just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They\\'re are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they\\'re paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\\n\\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\\n\\nNow, IF this happens, then it\\'s not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I\\'d say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!\\n\\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM\\'s and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don\\'t believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\\n\\nThe only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it\\'s getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it\\'s still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.\\n\\nWe\\'re at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven\\'t begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.\\n\\nTL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD.

And GME enthusiasts may be buying them as a conviction play (it may seem like we are helping ourselves buying here, but it plays into the short strategy...buying but as long as we hold it’s only a temporary decrease in SP). Imagine I have 1 million shares and I sell them in lots of 10,000 each lot $10 cheaper than the next. If people buy, I’ve lowered the stock price  by $100 effectively. It’s a classic short move.\\n\\nIf you don’t think Melvin and Shitron and the funds that propped them up aren’t calling in favors like this right now you’re living in fantasy land.\\n\\nSo for a small amount of shares you can take the price of the stock. It’s only going to save shorts though if once the stock is down everyone panics and sells at the new, lower price. If people hold the line, the stock may be down but shorts will have no one to buy shares to cover from, and the shares they used to drop the price will be exhausted. The volume typically tells the tale of a bear raid. There’s no way this is going to work- I feel like this plus the shutdown of wallstreetbets is just going to infuriate GME shareholders more to where holding is a moral issue.

Just look at Cramer:\\n\\n1) He’s called GME management to twist their arm into an offering, trying to protect these dirty cronies \\n\\n2) He’s congratulated Kurt Wolf on selling 90k shares IMPLYING HE SOLD IT FOR THE MONEY AND NOT BECAUSE HE HAD TO (the dishonesty is ridiculous and laughable)\\n\\n3) He’s congratulated WSB on the “short squeeze” (implying that little thing, was it—hoping we’ll back off)\\n\\nListen to me: \\n\\nYou know what kind of ppl Cramer is supporting here? You know what kind of crooks CNBC is promoting as good guys? These greedy little criminal fucking hedge funds tried to kill a good business and put tens of thousands out of work, all so they can make a quick buck. These are the people the media are protecting. This is what this war is about. \\n\\nThis is about the rich trying to get richer at the cost of the working man, and using every tool in their arsenal for protection when they’re cornered. \\n\\nCramer, CNBC, and the rest of the media are their dirty accomplices because guess what, THEY ARE THE MEDIA. They’re all one big conglomerate of steaming hot shit. \\n\\n...RETARDS, ASSEMBLE. \\n\\nI swear to God this has become personal after seeing how scared Cramer is. I didn’t believe any of this was true, but his reaction says it all. I’ve wanted nothing more than to stick it to them JUST ONCE. \\n\\nI’m throwing $10K into shares first thing at market open and holding till I’m fucking dead if it means just this once, this ONE fucking time, in all of history, that dumb money can take a W, and these dirty fucking crooks will learn dumb money, well they ain’t so dumb anymore... \\n\\nLET’S FUCKING GO LADS\\n\\n😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀🚀🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀😡🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀😡🚀😡😡😡🚀',\n",

       "  '30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb\\n\\nI\\'m glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front:\\n\\nWe were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:\\n\\n1.\\t\\u2060\\u2060Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We\\'ve been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We\\'ve been seeing these movements all week.\\n2.\\t\\u2060\\u2060Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn\\'t work.\\n3.\\t\\u2060\\u2060Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.\\n4.\\t\\u2060\\u2060Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.\\n5.\\t\\u2060\\u2060At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.\\n6.\\t\\u2060\\u2060Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.\\n7.\\t\\u2060\\u2060The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.\\n\\nOkay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn\\'t let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.\\n\\nI saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that\\'s true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.\\n\\nHow do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That\\'s what a liquidity crisis is.\\n\\nListen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn\\'t have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO \"PROTECT THE MARKET\"? Hello!  He\\'s not talking about the market for GME shares.  He\\'s talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.\\n\\nRemember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o\\n\\nIt kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It\\'s the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.\\n\\nTL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, \"Do I get my tendies now?\" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, \"They\\'re out of bullets!\" and create a stampede.  That\\'s how we win.\\n\\nThey needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I\\'m not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.\\n\\nCredit: u/PlayFree_Bird',\n",

       "  \"For anyone watching the situation on GME, please also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:\\n\\n1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.\\n\\n2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.\\n\\n3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.\\n\\n4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.\\n\\n5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.\\n\\n6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.\\n\\n7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen.

They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees.

Join a class action lawsuit against Robinhood to leverage the losses from the day you couldn't buy GME. Document evidence of owning GME (it will be in your Robinhood history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, you should join as a Named Class Representative for outcomes specific to you. These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud. Details are still coming.\\n\\n10. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over.

       "  \"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:\\n\\n1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.\\n\\n2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.\\n\\n3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.\\n\\n4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.\\n\\n5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.\\n\\n6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.\\n\\n7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.\\n\\n8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.\\n\\n9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over.

Here\\'s what I\\'ve found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:\\n\\n·They\\'ve covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They\\'re repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.\\n\\n·$BRUCE is the new $GME.\\n\\nPART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).\\n\\nPART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *\"listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.\"*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.\\n\\n·Fearmongering, in general. I\\'m tired of these posts.

There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...\\n\\n🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.\\n\\nThis weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.\\n\\nTLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.\\n\\nTake this opportunity by the balls and never let go. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\\n\\nUSE YOUR 💎🙌\"],\n",

There's an argument for the role of shorts in informing the market of companies at risk, but when a company is aggressively shorted it can drive the stock down enough to force businesses to go under.\\n\\nIn 2008 after the financial crises was set off, big market players heavily shorted Volkswagen stock. Porsche (who was known to be  trying to buy VW) quietly made a play to grab up stocks and then announced to the market over the long weekend that it now held more than 70% of the companies stock. Suddenly, the number of stocks available for trading was only half the number of stocks currently sold as shorts (these require the stock to be sold to close the trade), hedge funds were left scrambling to settle their shorts and buy stock at a reasonable price before the market inevitably squeezed and caused the share price to skyrocket. Share prices that day increased 5x and the major funds that were betting VW into bankruptcy lost huge amounts of money.  \\n\\nThe goal with GME is to essentially do the same, but with small investors leading the charge. People are buying shares and holding them to decrease the amount of available shares to trade and are hoping this will force a short squeeze, driving up prices and transferring wealth from hedge funds to small investors. At least, that is the story being told, and I'm personally in for a small amount to see how this plays out.\",\n",

When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.\\n\\nThen that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan. \\n\\nThat then accelerates the selling. \\n\\nWhich then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo what to do ? \\n\\nIf you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.

I do not mean this in any rude way but everyone makes their decisions themselves and is ultimately for themselves. We are not a pack here in WSB. We are individual investors who do not coordinate in any way on a stock. \\n\\nIf you see information that is scattered, like you mentioned, it is imperative to do your own research and figure out what is true and what is not. Not everyone who got in early on RKT did DD but the people who got in last week and knew about this definitely did. \\n\\nAs far as UWMC goes, I have seen a few posts about it but nothing close to the amount on RKT or GME. I plan on doing my own DD on UWMC tonight before deciding to go in tomorrow morning. \\n\\nI have no positions in UWMC as of now but I am intrigued enough to do some DD and possibly get in tomorrow. \\n\\nAnother major point to keep in mind, if you do get into something like RKT, make sure you have a PT in mind and do not be greedy. My EOW PT for RKT was hit today and I cashed out to secure my profits. Could it continue its run the rest of the week? Absolutely. Could it pullback and decline the rest of the week? Absolutely.

Yes, I know it's a new account. I was a lurker until this thing. Can someone put this on the original WSB as well? It keeps getting blocked.\\n\\nThere are two parts to this. First, I will start with what I found with media as it tells how I came to the heavy info, then I’ll get into the heavy stuff with the alleged crime. I have copies of all the public record documents, but have included links for where I found most of this info.\\n\\n**1.** **Media**\\n\\nWhile trading during the GME short-squeeze, I was wondering why CNN and CNBC cared so much about the Reddit/WallStreetBets and Gamestop frenzy, so I started digging into official business registrations and ownership records.\\n\\nReddit/WallStreetBets got spammed with discouraging bots and algorithms during trading, and the theory was Hedge funds were doing this to read our posts for momentum knowledge.\\n\\nNaomi M. Bergman is the **Senior Executive for Advanced Publications**. Advanced Publications is the **majority shareholder of Reddit**. Here's the connection... The same **Reddit majority shareholder exec is on the board of directors for comcast (owns CNBC).**\\n\\n**Weird how CNBC Reddit stories were so in-depth about Reddit and the bots got crazy pushing the narrative that CNBC was lying about!**\\n\\nAs for CNN, Richard W. Fisher is a senior advisor to **Barclay (dark pool trader of GME)** and board of directors of **AT&amp;T (owns CNN) and also a senior contributing editor of CNBC.**\\n\\nScott T. Ford AT&amp;T (**owns CNN) board of director and worked at maryl ynch (another black pool).**\\n\\n**All of this got me curious, so I started looking more. Here’s the heavy part…**\\n\\n**2.** **S3 Partners, Citadel, VIRTU and other Hedge Fund trading during a unlawful media campaign.**\\n\\nI started noticing that **S3 Partners**, a notorious advisory group for Wall Street was suddenly very vocal about narrating the story of Gamestop. I also noticed most of the CNBC and CNN articles used S3 Partners data in their stories. Also, retail traders on Reddit/WallStreetBets and everywhere use their date during due diligence and strategic investment planning. So I started looking at them through SEC documents, corporation filings, and audit trails (publicly available). This is what I found in only a couple hours….\\n\\nS3 securities was a subsidiary of S3 partners and partially owned by Knight Capital Group\\n\\n2013 KCG and Getco merged to form KCG Holdings\\n\\nKCG has 75% indirect interest ownership of all of Virtu holdings\\n\\nKCG turns into VIRTU KCGM\\n\\nVirtu KCGM was one of the dark pool traders\\n\\nVirtu bought KCG programs in 2011\\n\\nCitadel bought S3 Partner data and services in 2013\\n\\nKCG was bought by Citadel in 2016\\n\\nCitadel bailed out Melvin Capital on GME and is the biggest financial supporter of RobinHood, through paying RobinHood for retail trade data.\\n\\nCitadel (bought S3/KCG and the S3 data and services) gave Melvin Capital money to cover shorts while stopping RobinHood retail traders long enough for Melvin to get out. During this, S3 Partners’ fake “data” (owned by Citadel and Virtu and who knows who else) is used to posture a media campaign to discourage firms and retail traders from increasing the damage done to all of the Hedge Funds involved. The Stock market was also manipulated by the dark pool traders using their shares to trick algorithms into displaying numbers suitable for the Hedge Funds. S3 Partners controlled the narrative on this as well as being one of the traders through parent ownership.\\n\\nThe KCG that turned into Virtu KCG (Dark Pool GME) has traded BATS while serving in roles requiring financial disclosures.\\n\\nThe following positions have been held: Insider 2016 at Bats Global Markets, Inc.\\n\\nBats GM is owned by CBOE, who also owns BIDS ATS (another dark pool)\\n\\n**Dark pool traders related to S3 for a MINIMUM of 445,660 shares of GME traded 1,479 times in a single week between dark pool networks.**\\n\\n**3.** **About S3 Partners**\\n\\nFounded in 2003, S3 Partners is a financial technology company. Professional clients use our software, data and analytics for better self-directed outcomes in their investment processes, risk management, counterparty relationships, and investor relations.\\n\\nWhat makes S3 unique is our ability to drill into data on $2 trillion in daily financial transactions and distill actionable analytics, like short interest insight and market research. That’s why S3’s analytics are regularly referenced by over 100 media outlets, including The New York Times, Bloomberg, Business Insider, and many more. In addition, S3’s BLACK APP, is the best-selling app on the Bloomberg Terminal.\\n\\nS3 Securities was partner owned by Knight Capitol Group, who merged with Getco in 2013 to form KCG Holdings. KCG Holdings became Virtu KCG Holdings. Virtu KCG holdings was a dark pool trader of GME.\\n\\nThe KCG that turned into Virtu KCG (Dark Pool GME) has traded BATS while serving in roles requiring financial disclosures.\\n\\nThe following positions have been held: Insider 2016 at Bats Global Markets, Inc.\\n\\nBats GM is owned by CBOE, who also owns BIDS ATS (another dark pool)\\n\\n**Dark pool traders related to S3 for a MINIMUM of 445,660 shares of GME traded 1,479 times in a single week between dark pool network.**\\n\\nLinks in comments (this is too long)\\n\\nI can't even read.

I didn\\'t realize that when shorts are borrowed, the borrower has 3 days to use them, or they have to be returned. Shorts HAVE been borrowed, in large numbers, over the past few days. That means that hedgies were borrowing shorted shares, iron handing them, borrowing more, and then they released them all at once (or in large chunks because of the halts). That allowed them to tank the price in a very direct and focused manner, say $160 in a matter of 20 minutes (and that includes the halt times). I believe this was an attempt to trigger stop losses and scare day-traders into selling. The immediate rebound and the fact that THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO AMC, AT THE SAME TIME, seems to corroborate this theory.\\n\\nThanks to /u/_Exordium\\n, for explaining this rule for borrowing shorts!\\n\\n220@$125.61 average\\n\\nTLDR: Since there has been millions of shares shorted over the past few days, and they have 3 days to use the shorted shares, I think that the dip was caused by hedgies hoarding shorts to release all at once. Thus tanking the price and triggering stop losses and scaring day-traders into paperhanding. Also, exact same tactic used on AMC, at the exact same time.',\n",

The cup and handle is considered a bullish signal, with the right-hand side of the pattern typically experiencing lower trading volume. The pattern\\'s formation may be as short as seven\\xa0weeks or as long as 65 weeks.\"\\n\\nIf you open up the GME chart and look at it on a 3 month interval, you will be able to see the cup formed between our two peaks (Jan and now) and that it is clearly now in the phase where it has formed the \\'handle\\'. \\n\\nAdd this, to the newest Gamestop tweet that is literally a motherfucker sitting in a shaking rocket ship holding a mug and we have glory at its finest unfolding in front of our eyes. \\n\\nAs an added note: Be ready for extreme dips before and during squeezes, these are absolutely normal and they should not shake you one bit. Even during the MOASS there will be people paperhanding out at 1k, 5k, 10k, so naturally these will create declines in price from for example 5000 -&gt; 2000... but remember, the equation has gotten to a point where paper hands literally dont matter... we have found an infinite money glitch that they hate and are doing absolutely everything under the sun (even very irrational moves) to make themselves feel better about it. YES FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT. THERE IS NO WAY THEY CAN WIN AND THEY KNOW THIS, THEY JUST NEED TEMPORARY SURGES OF DOPAMINE RUSHES FOR THEIR SPOILED ENTITLED LITTLE BRAINS TO MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER.

From there I went heavy in some TSLA FD call spreads that I held into 0DTE and had back to back to back -50% days. \\n\\nI’d say see ya when the stimmy check comes, but that has to cover my late rent for March to keep the roof on over our heads. \\n\\nAnd I have $189 left so see you fucking tomorrow. \\n\\nImma go snowboard though. \\n\\n\\n\\nThis post is sponsored by theta gang — without you I wouldn’t have been able to make it this far so fast.

I read online to delete saved game data and try it. It worked for a second but it was glitching out super bad no loading all textures in game.\\n\\nThen I read maybe we would need to index the system. \\n\\nThe next day I turned it on to troubleshoot and it went directly into safe mode asking for an update file. We didn’t do anything we just turned the system off as normal the night before. \\n\\nThen I indexed the unit and initialized it and it started the system fresh. She had to set it up all over again. Had to reinstall and update gta again.\\n\\nNow she can only play about 10-20 min before it says that it’s corrupt or it just won’t load the game. Mind you I’ve had ps4 since it’s release and never had any issues like this and my game never glitches out while we’re playing together. \\n\\nI read it could be corrupt Hdd issue?\\n\\nWhat to expect from GameStop warranty?\\n\\nMy fear is that they give us a preowned unit that is 5 years old.

What I have realized is this: Many members on r/stocks, r/options, r/investing, and other finance subs believe that because they have a lot of experience trading, that they know a lot about the market. In reality, it is the opposite. They have conditioned themselves into a singular reality of an otherwise non-granular market.

Why attempt to engage in risky business when you have an established business model?\\n\\nIt is in this last statement that lies their fault. They've conditioned themselves to believe that any gain greater than 10% is risky, perhaps in part from MSM or other higher-up influences.

Seller gets paid for sale, Original Developer gets paid every sale. \\n\\nDigital download sale is easy executed. Physical items: central warehouses mail out to a store for pickup or direct to buyer. Many could still be stored on a physical shelf in a store and plucked and sent to a central warehouse with bulk deliveries 2-3 times a day if ordered on the exchange (in some cases it might make sense for an isolated store to have an arrangement with a FedEx office locally, etc.) Some items could be delivered locally direct from a store to buyer as appropriate. \\n\\nHuge savings to GME, bigger, more liquid used game market. New games supply still controlled by developer. Likely higher amounts could be paid to sellers, making them happier.  Developers would buy-in as they do get paid for every sale and still control the supply of new games. As every physical game sale unit entails packaging, warehousing, distribution the actual profit per unit to the Developers is less than many might think. So free money rolling in every time a game unit is resold would be hard to turn down. A long tail of profit. \\n\\nA crypto GMEcoin could be used for purchases with 2 prices quoted on E-exchange: GMEcoin and currency. \\n\\nWith 1 announcement, GME is undeniably an e-Commerce company with a different valuation basis. \\n\\nhat tip to u/roscoe_jones who initially inspired it.',\n",

Apparently you can’t set limit orders at any higher than some percentage (I think it was 10%?) above market value using their software - you have to speak to a senior investment advisor. The customer service rep I was speaking with was surprised, as he didn’t know about it. He put me on hold to confer with higher-ups. He came back and said this was a new restriction, placed late January/early February (!) *in response to market volatility* (!!!!!)\\n\\nI asked him to explain the reasoning here, because it seemed directly in conflict with the interests of their clients. Market volatility means bigger price movements, meaning traders should want to be able to set higher limit orders under these conditions, as they’d be more likely to be filled.

He has already put together a great team and we couldn't ask for a better person in charge to lead the transformation.\\n\\n5 - Stock Market and Wallstreet are corrupt. Fuck the hedgies, government and media. They have been stealing from the poor for decades and have killed numerous companies. They thought GME would be another but DFV and bunch of retarted Apes said NO. Enough is enough. They made a wrong bet and now they are trying to break/bend rules so they don't lose their trillions. \\n\\n6 - Ape Community.

Why run so many shares through dark pools and not try to push the price down?  Today it hit me.  They wanted another big price attack.  Drive down volume on lit exchanges (where prices are determined), so when you drop an extra million short shares in the supply; it will have the biggest price impact.  In addition there is the added benefit that people will see a jump in volume with the huge price decline and think everyone is bailing out.  Jokes on them.  My guess is BR didn’t have the mental block to see this days ago, like I did.  My guess is BR filed there 13f last week to calm nerves.

Since then, five Users have contracted to receive the services that were added in the Filing. On May 7, 2021, the Commission suspended the Filing and instituted proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved.5 Such action suspended the Exchange’s ability to offer access to Third Party Systems from Long Term Stock Exchange, Members Exchange, MIAX Emerald, MIAX PEARL Equities, Morgan Stanley, and TD Ameritrade, and to offer connectivity to Third Party Data Feeds from ICE Data Services - ICE TMC, Members Exchange, MIAX Emerald, and MIAX PEARL Equities (together, the “Suspended Services”). The Commission’s suspension of such services is likely to cause disruption to the current Users of such services, who must now acquire substitutes for the Suspended Services. As an accommodation to such current Users, the Exchange now proposes to provide the Suspended Services to all Users, at no charge, for a period of 14 days from the date of filing (“Transition Period”), to enable current Users to maintain their connectivity while establishing alternate connectivity.\\n\\nSo they must have created these dark pools in March when the price was getting away from them again.

As far as I can tell, the original system would remove the pledged securities from the account of the party making the loan and put them in the account that they\\'re being loaned to. The change appears to be that the securities will stay in the original account, and just have a notation. Is the thought that within the original system, that those loaned securities could subsequently be loaned out again and again? And this \"notation\" would prevent that? This language has not changed in the description of the old/new systems: \"prevents the pledged position from being used to complete other transactions\" which is why I\\'m not convinced it will actually change anything material. Maybe the addition of \"The system systematically\" is a promising change, but that\\'s the language we\\'re reading into here.\\n\\nI also think the OCC pledge/release changes are just made to conform to the notation language.\\n\\nI hope I\\'m misinterpreting this, and am open to other thoughts.

You have $500+$250-$200=$550 as your capital.\\n\\nYou're still good because you maintain sufficient capital to not default.\\n\\nBut now, ICC decides to eliminate your usage of those bonds as collateral. Boom. Now you only have $550-$500=$50 to post for your capital. This in itself is a type of haircut. It trims off your capital in your net capital calculations.\\n\\nThey might even determine certain securities are at high risk and require more capital for those positions. That's another haircut because it reduces your total capital even more. (Post more liquidity please). They might decide that instead of 100% of your position in cash, you need 200%.

What if HFs shorted and continue to short GME so recklessly, and there are hundreds of millions of shares to cover now? And retail apes have been buying them up this whole time, so that now you may actually have a situation where a few million people holding onto 5-10 shares forever and refusing to sell (or 400k apes that hold xx) can control the float *forever*?\\n\\nThe ideal outcome for apes is that enough people sell at ridiculous numbers to become rich and get short interest under 100% so that markets can resume, but that some actually go beyond diamond handing and maintain an Infinity pool to keep GameStop share price extremely high post squeeze (think along the lines of GME becoming the new brk.a).

You are right Reconstitution of the Russell index happens EOD June 25th, and that tends to be one of the biggest trading days of the years as Russell tracking ETFs dump some companies while adding new ones.  So GME will be leaving the Russell 2000 and I noticed also the Russell MicroCap index so ETFs tracking them we remove GME, while GME will be added to the Russell 1000.  This happens right after your June 24th date where you suggest GME will have some buying pressure.\\nBut my question is about the heavily shorted Russell 2000 ETFs which of course hold GME.  What happens to that effective GME short when GME is sold or transferred out of the fund?  At that instant, the fund is still short but GME is no longer in it.  What is the impact on that GME short?  Would it become like a naked short?  \\nSecondly, is it true that it will be more difficult for SHF to pull the same trick on the Russell 1000 ETFs as GME will have a much lower weighting in those ETFs?  Will there be any impact on the Net Capital requirements when GME is no longer in the Russell 2000 ETFs?  Or can they simply close them out as they are long in the other underlying stocks?

This was an increase from 1.85% of all OTC trades in January, 0.17% in December, and 0.11% in November.

The SHF sells the OTM Covered PUTs to Citadel and pockets the premiums. \\n2. This effectively raises their short position cost basis and increases their margin call price.\\n3. The drawback is that they don\\'t get as much profit off of the short positions but they give themselves some protection.\\n4. Upon expiration, the SHFs keep the premium. They don\\'t expire worthless except for on the side of Citadel.\\n\\nI am open to the idea that they used these Covered PUTs to do some balance sheet trick where they shifted their liabilities from \"being short N number of GME shares\" to having liabilities with Citadel regarding the PUTs themselves. Which could have technically hid their shorts. **But I don\\'t know of any source that would back this theory up**.\\n\\nAs a side note, I have noticed that the number of OTM PUTs opened in January roughly lines up with the alleged 226% SI on January 15th.

The most rational decision for those folks would be to hodl to exit the Matrix, not to paperhand for 6-7 Figures. If this theory is correct I imagine that this cohort would be ridiculously vocal about any Fed intervention around not getting paid…think about it: the threat of those folks quitting their careers out of anger (re: disposable income) to change the obvious BS is way worse for the economy than giving these people the means to reinvest once everything is rebuilt.

According to [their Q1’21 13F on fintel](https://fintel.io/i13f/simplex-trading-llc/2021-03-31-0) they ended Q4’20 with 2,573 put contracts for GME, and then ended Q1’21 with 80,702 put contracts for GME at a $0 imputed share price.

A\\n\\nLast week, we say lots of $200 puts expiring on June 25 exibiting the same behavior on the options chain.\\n\\nI'm working on a DD that illuminates a shift in tactics from OTM Puts to hide SI to near OTM Puts that require the market makers to sell to the market to delta hedge (it's the opposite of buying calls that requires them to delta hedge by purchasing shares to remain neutral on the trade).\\n\\nEssentially, since about June 24, we've seen a rise in $200 Puts purchased, which is out of the money but also probably close enough to being in that it requires the market maker to react. That reaction generates selling pressure that suppresses price without SHFs needing to borrow or naked short themselves. Is this a result of regs changing and them losing access to being able to borrow the same share twice? Maybe.\\n\\nAnd today, it's the opposite with call options. \\n\\nTL;DR: I think they are out of rounds in the mag and are trying to pistol whip, fisticuffs, and wet willie GME into submission.

Did anyone think they were just going to roll over and let it happen. Think of it as an offset, but with an ever increasing cost of doing business. As long as they can find the money, there is nothing to prevent them from continuing this behavior.\\n\\nThat being said, in a contrarian system, they are up against an ever increasing cost.  As the price floor rises on the stock (either due to people holding because they like the stock and or naturally due to the transformation of the company) the ability to kick the can gets more expensive. Eventually, and we don't know when, their ability to keep the price below a threshold level will fail, that will be the first margin call. \\n\\nThat itself does not mean a squeeze. They can pay that, show collateral, find other assets at that time, that does not mean it goes nuts. It only will end up parabolic when the short positions have to close their positions, that will be the demand on a lack of supply that I don't think this market has ever seen. \\n\\nThe sentiment you're feeling (and I am sure everyone who has delved into the fundamentals of this investment has felt as well) is tough. It is hard to stand up for what you know is right in the face of gas lighting and trickery. Attrition is a long game, and luckily for investors who believe in companies, they are in the long position. As far as I am concerned, I am in it to win it with GME, the downside risk against this company's future is low, and the upside potential of the company on its own is high. \\n\\nTo add to that, when a squeeze happens coincidentally because some really wealthy people risked the entire market so they could commit financial crimes to line their pockets due to the belief that they control the world, that is just icing on the cake for average Joes like us (no offense meant if you are above-average ;)) \\n\\nThis is not financial advice, just one ape trying to reconcile the question above with his glass smooth brain.\",\n",

By kicking the can, I mean the point in time when they actually have to deliver the GME shares. In the past this was 35 days for market makers however the new rules we saw lately did apparently some changes to this but we will have to see whether they are enforced or not.\\n\\nFor example: You hide a couple of short sells in 1 deep OTM put to a certain date. If the dates come and your put is not in the money, you have T+X days to deliver the shares. If you can’t it becomes a FTD. \\n\\nSome FTDs are normal in the system but huge amounts of FTDs like above indicate huge fuckery and that they cannot or don’t want to deliver these shares. However, please also note that these FTDs above are cumulative, meaning this is the net open FTDs on a specific date. So by the end of June they somehow managed to „deliver“ these huge spikes of FTDs of the days before. And by „deliver“ I mean that they most likely kicked the can down the road again. So as long as authorities do not really tackle this issue, FTDs do not help that much.

I\\'ve seen coordinated attacks by the media and stock movement that is just plain wrong. \\n\\nI buy and hold like Buffet because of all the research I\\'ve done and seen. I don\\'t need to complicate things with any derivatives because I only see one play here.  \\n\\nWhen a multi-billion dollar monster loses to a basic buy and hold, methinks the issue is with the bad bets they made, not with investors believing in the company. Complexity doesn\\'t mean better. Sophistication doesn\\'t mean better. And NEITHER of those means \"correct,\" either.   A smart entity would have closed position months ago, and instead they\\'re now hanging their asses out and screeching at retail.  Retail is just a scapegoat, anyway.  This is big boi battle, retail is the wildcard, and their smart, sophisticated, complex algorithms forgot that people can just fucking diamond hand with nothing to lose.\\n\\nAlso, this isn\\'t gambling.  When I bought my house it wasn\\'t a gamble, it was an investment.  Same for my GME. THEIR position is a gamble, because they haven\\'t closed.  They want to push that moniker onto retail as well.
